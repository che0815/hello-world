# Artificial Intelligence
*Bailey:* [Strong vs. Weak AI](https://katbailey.github.io/post/reframing-the-ai-effect/): (...) And humans use numerous abilities in playing chess. Surely an AI would need all those abilities too. But then along came Deep Blue: a computer that could beat any human chess player in the world, but could do absolutely nothing else. Surely this wasn’t the holy grail we had sought! (...)

##### Gaussian Processes for Dummies by Katherine Bailey
[Bailey's Blog Post](https://katbailey.github.io/post/gaussian-processes-for-dummies/)
(...) The GP approach, in contrast, is a non-parametric approach, in that it finds a distribution over the possible functions 
f(x) that are consistent with the observed data (...)
